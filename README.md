Tools for Organizing

- Tools

  The key to effecting organizing a conference is having structure and tools.
  Each tool should be focused on a singular task
- Platforms

  Platforms allow for a set of related tools to be grouped together. While this
  doesn't mean the tools must be implemented in the same package, it does mean
  special care should be taken to ensure communication between the tools of a
  platform works seamlessly.
- Documentation

  Powerful tools require well written documentation. Not only does good
  documentation help ensure that tools can be run and maintained, well written
  documentation helps eliminate scope issues and redundancy. Documentation is
  preferred over tools, in a circumstance where there is a forced choice between
  strong documentation and a tool, the documentation should be chosen.

Proposed tools
==============

###Task management
The task management tool should enforce specific constraints on tasks that
ensure there is ample information included to allows any member of the
organizing team with a rough idea of context to perform the action. This means
tasks should include a who, what, where, when, why, and how.

###Voting management system
Making decisions is important to keep organizing on track. Voting on topics
should be easy to do and proposing a vote should be simple and clear. There
should be a simple system that can be used to enter a task that can be voted
on. The voting system should consist of more than a simple majority or super
majority system, allowing for a more accurate representation of the team's
actual opinions. This means there should be at least ranked and rated options
added to the system.

###Communication platform
Effectively managing the conference and maintaining high attendance numbers
requires solid communication. To execute this goal a strong communication
campaign a central place to oversee the communication effort and analyze it is
required. The communication platform should plug into the various social media
sites being used and report back information on the effectiveness of the
campaign. The platform should also allow things such a scheduling social media
blasts and email campaigns.

###Session Platform
####Session Scheduling
Scheduling the actual events for the conference is always a daunting tasks. It
requires a combination of time slots, rooms, and sessions. In addition to this
structure there is also the need to separate by event and include the metadata
of track.

####Session Submission
Collecting sessions is important for the events of the conference. There should
be a single unified interface for submitting sessions and then selecting which
sessions to accept. The sessions should be piped into the scheduling system for
the acceptance process and should only be marked as accepted once they have been
scheduled into a timeslot and room. Emails of acceptance should only be sent out
once the schedule has been locked.

###Attendance platform
Allowing a smooth registration process for attendees is important. Having a
confusing system that leans more toward helping the organizers of the conference
should not be used over one that allows for ease of registration for attendees.
Attendees should have to create an account with the system and then register for
individual events. For a conference of conferences, there should be the ability
to bundle together several events into a single registration for ease of use.
The system should allow individual event registrations in addition to the
bundles.
